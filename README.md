# Slider Crank Simulation in MATLAB

This repository contains "Slider Crank Simulation in MATLAB" where, I implemented a simulation providing a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics of a slider crank mechanism. Users can explore the system's behavior in terms of force, acceleration, velocity, and position by inputting relevant parameters. Slider Crank is a fundamental component in various mechanical systems including engines, pumps, and robotics. I created this simulation under the guidance of Prof. K. V. Gangadharan at NITK, with the help of my teammates - G.O.V Umesh Chandra, Pranav Sudheer and R. Sai Datta Praneeth. This project offers a user-friendly platform for studying and analyzing the performance characteristics of slider crank systems with intuitive usage instructions and clear visualizations of the simulation results.
